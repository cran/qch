\usage{
PvalSets_cor
}
\description{
PvalSets_cor is a data.frame with 10,000 rows and 3 columns. Each row corresponds to an item,
columns 'Pval1' and 'Pval2'  each correspond to a test serie over the items, and column 'Class'
provides the truth, i.e. if item \eqn{i} belongs to class 1 then the H0 hypothesis is true for the 2 tests,
if item \eqn{i} belongs to class 2 (resp. 3) then the H0 hypothesis is true for the first (resp. second)
test only, and if item \eqn{i} belongs to class 4 then both H0 hypotheses are false (for the first
and the second test). The correlation between the two pvalues series within each class is 0.3.
